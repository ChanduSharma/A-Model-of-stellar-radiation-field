# A-Model-of-stellar-radiation-field
A partial project for simulating the dust particles in the interstellar radiation fields in the galaxy.This project is not complete as the harddrive crashed before the final commit.Also, most of the scripts written here are standalone scripts that were to be added in a single object oriented project.
